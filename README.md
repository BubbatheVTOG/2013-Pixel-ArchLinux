# Arch Linux for the 2013 Chromebook Pixel
The Chromebook Pixel (2013) is an iconic piece of hardware. Since it's debut in 2013 I have dreamed of owning one. This last year the 5 years of support from the mothership Google HQ has stopped. Thus, you can now buy a pixel from retailers for a fraction of the price, but Google has stopped supporting it. To me it seemed like the perfect Linux laptop with its great high quality hardware and solid build. I know that there are other people out there that are hoping to purchase this hardware and run "normal" Linux on it. So I've decided to make this guide/wiki for other people who are fighting the hardware as much as I have.
